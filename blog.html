     Our first reading gave me a lot to think about regarding my own aestheic choices and work. I do my best to produce images of quality while at the same time I believe the variation provides texture from found archives for materials in the digital realm. It makes me think of the standards I have held myself to about achieving a technical quality in my work and how this perpetuates an elitist philosohpy, yet I recognized get the distinct now that with expanded access to more and more advanced technologies improving so rapidly it should be easier than ever to make high quality work. For better or worse, this piece was written in  a slightly earlier time (2009) and we have come a long way in the last 15 years with regard to poor images. The ability to restore originals has improved along with the capacity of the internet to host alternative cinemas as streaming sources has expanded profoundly, but it also also limited the quality and the connection through self/collective promotion or community building that was so foundational in these third spaces and networks. With the expansion of access there is also a lacking in sense of community. Luckily in New York these haven's still exist but they are also not garunteed to be inclusive. This flattening out of content which ranges from porn to paranoia to paraphrase the article feels quite real and relateable but in the time since this was written those 2 ends of the spectrum seem to have formed more of a blurrly loop and its hard to jump out once you are in. From food to travel to relationships, sports to pop music all very on forms of paranoia and porn- and the poorer the image perhaps the easier to see that for that for what it is.

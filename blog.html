        Constituents of a Theory of Media while at times slightly repetitive in connection to its references to Benjamin, expands and grounds into several resonant ideas nicely. Namely that media in times of political upheaval increases access to the proletariat yet eventually manages to be overtaken by the bourgeoise, which leads into the suggestion that instead of a socialist/marxist aversion to these new forms instead movements toward adoption/adaptation would be beneficial.

		I’d argue given the advancements since this article was written- this advice has been taken to heart with the evolution of apps like TikTok or event that of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram- it seems is a continued expansion of access though now instead these platforms have become overrun by particular demographics now as opposed to general elites. For example, the aging of Facebook and co-opting from youth culture (as it started as an exclusively college centric platform) or with the purchase and rebranding of Twitter to X that platform seems more exclusively for Elon Musk and a more secular manosphere. TikTok it seems is a more complex application and its rise is undoubtedly linked the the pandemic- but now having been purchased by a Zionist investment fund called Oracle- it seems unlikely to last as and already has shown signs of decline with the rise of the influencer culture, along with instagram.

		That said, these platforms will only continue to iterate exponentially again and again- the question it seems is how to embrace the new mediums they develop quickly enough to keep up or to slow the pace long enough for the masses to stay on the same page. This metaphor brings to the last piece of the reading which struck a different note but one that still warrants further reflection - the spoken vs written word. It’s true that the written word has been a dominant format for the last few centuries but in the history of humanity that is a rather limited timeframe. It’s also true that written communication as opposed to verbal communication is in some ways more limited and therefore more difficult. This might explain the rise of the podcasting era we now find ourselves in, but regardless - it seems that the written word isn’t going away, and if anything has been incorporated into new platforms and technologies.

    		Society of the Spectacle is still very relevant today- it’s the natural progression of the mediated life that was outlined by Debord which has permeated further than could be imagined. With the acceleration of technological advancement no one could have predicted just how far these spectacles would have gone and where we find ourselves now in a post-pandemic reality with more spectacles than consumers. What I personally have found is that most spectacles are not worth while if it feels impossible to maintain a sense of participation or and sense of autonomy within them, and this has become more pronounced over time. All anyone can seem to do is limit their own options of platforms for spectacle consumption in their life, or curate the paths for mediation then practice maintaining a sense of presence as whenever possible. What this comes down to (at least for me) is attempting to create a balanced engagement of inner and outer life that allows for personal and collective decision making. Smaller more localized group spectacles manage to allow for a certain sense of personal functionality within group cooperation.

            As We May Think, the speculative essay from Vannevar Bush feels familiar though I am sure I have not read it before. This is not simply because it predicts modern technologies before they were built. No, its that on essential and human reasoning which grounds the experience of discovering new technologies is the recognition that we cannot fully absorb the impact of what this will do or consume all the informatiom no matter how hard we may try. That despite even our most recent advancements, human associative logic still is more complex and nuanced and these mechanisms will never be able to quite capture this naïveté of intimate reality.  It’s a comforting perspective to hear, especially from someone who managed to make a few accurate predictions. The ending of the piece seems a bit too nonchalant in reference to society potentially never managing to using technological advancement for its truest good, but still ends on a hopeful note that it would be a waste to give up that goal. All in all, I find this rather comforting somehow. The combinations of scientific objective ambivalence combined with a sort of dry pragmatic rhetoric feel sincere. It’s not seeking to convince, comfort of scare the reader- simply to lay out some possibilities and potential applications.


				I think this is obviously an even more crucial conversation now than when Vannervar was trying to have it. I am not fearful of AI (in regard to the sense that it may manage to develop the naïveté I wrote of earlier) but as other technological advancements such as meta glasses and the iPhone have come closer and closer to fulfilling the inventions he envisioned and more- the question of how to go about embracing this technology gets more complex. Blindly accepting these conveniences, even to the point of relying on them more than ones own perspective and experience is important, but resentment and resistance to these advancements as well even for their environmental implications seems a bit too convenient and based in fear.  It’s unclear to me where the best course of action lies except somewhere in the middle, as newer users hopefully we will be those that find new limitations and ways to use it in service of the truest good.

		The text this week provided some interesting considerations with regard to the mediated image, namely that context is everything. Walter Benjamin goes in depth with his analysis of the evolution of photography and film despite the piece being written almost 90 years ago when these mediums were just beginning to take hold, and still manages to stay relevant today with content creation and streaming platforms. I would suggest however that we have reached a new level of aura degradation from artworks that they art often unrecognizable. Simple beauty isn’t art and the sublime becomes harder and harder to achieve.
	This reality gives me an existential sense that while art still manages to matter and impact the ways in which the masses consume and participate in media, it also means we have passed a point of no return and that the road forward is a freeing but destructive one. This may be due to the fact as Benjamin explains that Art was once based around ritual but through the practice of reproduction that has been reversed and art becomes more about politics- and politics at this moment are becoming dire.
	Many have said that the moments of greatest political turmoil present the strongest opportunities for art, however I am not sure of that anymore. It’s not to say that its not possible but there are plenty of countries and places that have been under dictatorship for decades now and censored severely so perhaps there is art being made that I am not getting to experience, but perhaps a deeper need for survival has taken hold and whatever art is created needs to be functional or serve an additional purpose. I am all for functionality however I cannot help but wonder of the capitalist implications that has already begun to influence how and why art is made.
	On a separate note, Benjamin’s writing on the comparing and contrasting of theater and film actors seems especially effective at articulating the similarities and differences in this new media landscape that we find ourselves in. Sections 8 and 9 capture this difference effectively and articulate a fundamental performance approach in the mediums of photography and film which is that the subjects themselves are the art whereas more “fine” works (painting, sculpture) are they artworks themselves. Of course this isn’t true all the time but it seems that even now as artful as a piece of video or photography may be if there is no subject/object embodied within it something is lacking- we cannot make the same abstractions with film as with painting, yet we can repurpose and reproduce paintings for different abstractions. This leads me to wonder through photography and film if we are in fact degrading the subjects/objects instead of the videos themselves….

     Our first reading gave me a lot to think about regarding my own aestheic choices and work. I do my best to produce images of quality while at the same time I believe the variation provides texture from found archives for materials in the digital realm. It makes me think of the standards I have held myself to about achieving a technical quality in my work and how this perpetuates an elitist philosohpy, yet I recognized get the distinct now that with expanded access to more and more advanced technologies improving so rapidly it should be easier than ever to make high quality work. For better or worse, this piece was written in  a slightly earlier time (2009) and we have come a long way in the last 15 years with regard to poor images. The ability to restore originals has improved along with the capacity of the internet to host alternative cinemas as streaming sources has expanded profoundly, but it also also limited the quality and the connection through self/collective promotion or community building that was so foundational in these third spaces and networks. With the expansion of access there is also a lacking in sense of community. Luckily in New York these haven's still exist but they are also not garunteed to be inclusive. This flattening out of content which ranges from porn to paranoia to paraphrase the article feels quite real and relateable but in the time since this was written those 2 ends of the spectrum seem to have formed more of a blurrly loop and its hard to jump out once you are in. From food to travel to relationships, sports to pop music all very on forms of paranoia and porn- and the poorer the image perhaps the easier to see that for that for what it is.

		The text this week provided some interesting considerations with regard to the mediated image, namely that context is everything. Walter Benjamin goes in depth with his analysis of the evolution of photography and film despite the piece being written almost 90 years ago when these mediums were just beginning to take hold, and still manages to stay relevant today with content creation and streaming platforms. I would suggest however that we have reached a new level of aura degradation from artworks that they art often unrecognizable. Simple beauty isn’t art and the sublime becomes harder and harder to achieve.
	This reality gives me an existential sense that while art still manages to matter and impact the ways in which the masses consume and participate in media, it also means we have passed a point of no return and that the road forward is a freeing but destructive one. This may be due to the fact as Benjamin explains that Art was once based around ritual but through the practice of reproduction that has been reversed and art becomes more about politics- and politics at this moment are becoming dire.
	Many have said that the moments of greatest political turmoil present the strongest opportunities for art, however I am not sure of that anymore. It’s not to say that its not possible but there are plenty of countries and places that have been under dictatorship for decades now and censored severely so perhaps there is art being made that I am not getting to experience, but perhaps a deeper need for survival has taken hold and whatever art is created needs to be functional or serve an additional purpose. I am all for functionality however I cannot help but wonder of the capitalist implications that has already begun to influence how and why art is made.
	On a separate note, Benjamin’s writing on the comparing and contrasting of theater and film actors seems especially effective at articulating the similarities and differences in this new media landscape that we find ourselves in. Sections 8 and 9 capture this difference effectively and articulate a fundamental performance approach in the mediums of photography and film which is that the subjects themselves are the art whereas more “fine” works (painting, sculpture) are they artworks themselves. Of course this isn’t true all the time but it seems that even now as artful as a piece of video or photography may be if there is no subject/object embodied within it something is lacking- we cannot make the same abstractions with film as with painting, yet we can repurpose and reproduce paintings for different abstractions. This leads me to wonder through photography and film if we are in fact degrading the subjects/objects instead of the videos themselves….

     Our first reading gave me a lot to think about regarding my own aestheic choices and work. I do my best to produce images of quality while at the same time I believe the variation provides texture from found archives for materials in the digital realm. It makes me think of the standards I have held myself to about achieving a technical quality in my work and how this perpetuates an elitist philosohpy, yet I recognized get the distinct now that with expanded access to more and more advanced technologies improving so rapidly it should be easier than ever to make high quality work. For better or worse, this piece was written in  a slightly earlier time (2009) and we have come a long way in the last 15 years with regard to poor images. The ability to restore originals has improved along with the capacity of the internet to host alternative cinemas as streaming sources has expanded profoundly, but it also also limited the quality and the connection through self/collective promotion or community building that was so foundational in these third spaces and networks. With the expansion of access there is also a lacking in sense of community. Luckily in New York these haven's still exist but they are also not garunteed to be inclusive. This flattening out of content which ranges from porn to paranoia to paraphrase the article feels quite real and relateable but in the time since this was written those 2 ends of the spectrum seem to have formed more of a blurrly loop and its hard to jump out once you are in. From food to travel to relationships, sports to pop music all very on forms of paranoia and porn- and the poorer the image perhaps the easier to see that for that for what it is.

      <div> <h3> Artist Bio </h3> </div>
       <p> Nina Bowers is a collagist who works in time structured mediums including documentary
video, placemaking installations, soundscape scores and narratives, and improvisational or
choreographed performance. She draws from her life through familial and personal archiving,
observational research, and lived experience to reflect on societal relationships with death, care,
aging, femininity, family, and environment. In playing with these themes her work points to
conceptual ceremonies, co-creation memorials, sensory events, and liminal placemaking. Her
practice is built on deconstructing, ritualizing, and complicating human narratives to form
community and connection.
She received her undergraduate degree in Theater with Culture and Media at The New
School and is currently completing her MFA at Hunter College in Integrated Media Arts. Nina
has completed intensives and workshops at UCLA, Deep Play Institute, Abrons Arts Center,
Movement Research, Soundial, Morbid Anatomy, BRIC Arts Media, Mono No Aware, Pratt
Institute, Torn Page & William Esper Studio. She has done cultural development work with Film
Forum, St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn Fire Proof, Brooklyn Bridge Park, and Center for
Performance Research, Still Films, Fancy Film, Moving Arts, and Bootleg Theater. </p>
      
     <div> <h3>Abstract</h3> </div> 
      <p> The experience of having a yard in Brooklyn while seen as a true amenity that is worthy of bragging rights is also not without a lot of complexity as a renter, as its a space that you are able to inhabit and stewart but only to a certain degree. The way in which nature has shaped this space and continues to shift it from season to season year to year is a fascinating and awe inspiring thing to witness, but the yard is also a lonesome space. For the most part I enjoy this solitude, this like patch of ground that I am able to be surrounded by building and neighboring yards of others while at the same time seperated, but its a strange feeling in this city of millions. I've hosted a few events in the yard but even then the work that is involved makes it overwhelming to do regularly. </p>

<div> <h3>Zine Poster</h3> </div> 
      <p> The process of creating this piece was difficult, but here is a start. Words are from the essay titled Yonder by Siri Hustvedt which has been an inspirtation for me with regard to memory, location and our shifting relationships with place/space and time.</p>

      <h2> Project Concept</h2>
      <h3>Abstract</h3>
      <p> The experience of having a yard in Brooklyn while seen as a true amenity that is worthy of bragging rights is also not without a lot of complexity as a renter, as its a space that you are able to inhabit and stewart but only to a certain degree. The way in which nature has shaped this space and continues to shift it from season to season year to year is a fascinating and awe inspiring thing to witness, but the yard is also a lonesome space. For the most part I enjoy this solitude, this like patch of ground that I am able to be surrounded by building and neighboring yards of others while at the same time seperated, but its a strange feeling in this city of millions. I've hosted a few events in the yard but even then the work that is involved makes it overwhelming to do regularly. </p>

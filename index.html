      <div> <h3> Artist Bio </h3> </div>
       <p> Nina Bowers is a collagist who works in time structured mediums including documentary
video, placemaking installations, soundscape scores and narratives, and improvisational or
choreographed performance. She draws from her life through familial and personal archiving,
observational research, and lived experience to reflect on societal relationships with death, care,
aging, femininity, family, and environment. In playing with these themes her work points to
conceptual ceremonies, co-creation memorials, sensory events, and liminal placemaking. Her
practice is built on deconstructing, ritualizing, and complicating human narratives to form
community and connection.
She received her undergraduate degree in Theater with Culture and Media at The New
School and is currently completing her MFA at Hunter College in Integrated Media Arts. Nina
has completed intensives and workshops at UCLA, Deep Play Institute, Abrons Arts Center,
Movement Research, Soundial, Morbid Anatomy, BRIC Arts Media, Mono No Aware, Pratt
Institute, Torn Page & William Esper Studio. She has done cultural development work with Film
Forum, St. Ann's Warehouse, Brooklyn Fire Proof, Brooklyn Bridge Park, and Center for
Performance Research, Still Films, Fancy Film, Moving Arts, and Bootleg Theater. </p>
      
     <div> <h3>Abstract</h3> </div> 
      <p> The experience of having a yard in Brooklyn while seen as a true amenity that is worthy of bragging rights is also not without a lot of complexity as a renter, as its a space that you are able to inhabit and stewart but only to a certain degree. The way in which nature has shaped this space and continues to shift it from season to season year to year is a fascinating and awe inspiring thing to witness, but the yard is also a lonesome space. For the most part I enjoy this solitude, this like patch of ground that I am able to be surrounded by building and neighboring yards of others while at the same time seperated, but its a strange feeling in this city of millions. I've hosted a few events in the yard but even then the work that is involved makes it overwhelming to do regularly. </p>

<div> <h3>Zine Poster</h3> </div> 
      <p> The process of creating this piece was difficult, but here is a start. Words are from the essay titled Yonder by Siri Hustvedt which has been an inspirtation for me with regard to memory, location and our shifting relationships with place/space and time.</p>
   <div>
        <img src="IMGBB/Page1.jpg" style="width:75%" />

<div> <h3> After Effects Illustration </h3>
      <p> I feel that I got somewhere relatively good with this and that with more time and attention I should be able to complete the series of images to be evocative of something. I ran into issues that I still need to troubleshoot but was able to figure out a general workflow/process for doing these which was helpful.</p>

<div> <h3> Randomized Yonder </h3>
      <p> Using this text from the writer Siri Hustveldt I attempted to connect word aand image in more ways than one and read into both through annimating the writing and reading it aloud. I am pleased with the effect and am sure that with some tuning and tweaks I could refine it further, but for now it serves the purpose and point nicely. The piece reflects on the elusive nature of language, landscape and our minds- how we relate to space and how we relate to language can be rather subjective and the phenomenology of that is rather fascinating. I might like to make some type or interactive element where the number types in between 1-7 brings that up, or that if you keep inputting what you get and adding up the numbers something else happens.
      Mostly it was cool and intersting to articulate myself, vision and ideas in different ways than I have explored before through after effects and coding, and while I do not feel especially refined in my taste for it yet or capable of controlling all the elements it does seem to be getting the feel of editing in the practice and with more intention and reptition could become more natural or generative in fun ways.
